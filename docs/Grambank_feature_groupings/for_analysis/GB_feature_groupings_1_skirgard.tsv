GB303	NA	"Is there a phonologically free antipassive marker (""particle"" or ""auxiliary"")?"	particle, auxiliary	antipassive, valency change, derivation, valency decrease	particle, auxiliary	Jakob	Antipassive markers detransitivize verbs by removing the P argument or realizing it as an oblique complement. In languages that have ergative alignment, this means that the ergative argument (A) becomes absolutive (S). Antipassive markers often also have other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative.  In practice, it is possible to define this feature as targeting any intransitivising marker that is not a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets phonologically independent particles or auxiliaries marking antipassive clauses.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB303 AntipassiveFree	NA	clause	NA	31	Clause SubCo 2	31Clause SubCo 2
GB149	morphinverse	Is there a morphologically marked inverse on verbs?	verb, index	argument marking, core	NA	Jakob	Inverse systems (as defined in this project) are based on an animacy or person hierarchy (e.g. first/second person > third person > cats > dogs > other animals > inanimates). Languages can have markers on transitive verbs that indicate whether the agent(-like argument) of the clause is higher on this hierarchy than the patient(-like argument) [= direct marker], or whether the reverse is true, i.e. that the patient outranks the agent on the hierarchy [= inverse marker]. An example would be 'man INV-bite dog' to mean 'the dog bit the man'. Note that in some languages, there are portmanteau morphemes that both function as a person index on verbs and as direct/inverse markers, so different person indexes are used based on where the agent and patient are located relative to each other on the hierarchy. This counts as a 1 for this question.

This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appendixed text of the grammar should reveal this (to a certain extent). In some languages the only way to do nominal coordination is with a comitative phrase, i.e., the only way to say X and Y is to say X with Y. This feature aims to capture such languages (which, as they have no difference between coordination and comitatives for nouns, get a 0). To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating check for case marking, agreement etc. For example, if X is the element in question and in the dative you get 'John-DAT X Mary-DAT' then X is likely coordinating, while if you get John-DAT X Mary then X is likely comitative. Or with agreement, if you get 'John X Mary verb-PL' rather than 'John X Mary verb-SG' (just like 'John X suitcase verb-SG') then that suggests X is likely coordinating.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB027 ComitConjDifferent	Is there a difference between the marking of NP coordination ('John and Mary went to market') and the marking of comitative phrases ('John went to market with Mary')?	clause	NA	11	Nom Morph 2	11Nom Morph 2

Gender/noun class assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the phonological properties of the noun are one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their phonological properties for this feature to be coded (1). That is, some phonological property of a noun must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Examples of phonological properties that may play a role in gender/class assignment include tone or initial consonants. Note that noun class/gender morphology may create phonological similarities across members of a certain noun class or gender; however, this is not sufficient for a (1) coding for this feature. Phonological properties must contribute to the categorization of nouns to classes/genders, rather than simply result from associated morphology.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB192 GenderPhono	NA	nominal domain	NA	4	Noun Class9	4Noun Class9
GB196	NA	Is there a male/female distinction in 2nd person independent pronouns?	pronoun	gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah	This feature asks whether the independent pronoun forms used for second person differ according to the sex of the referent. Specifically, languages that qualify for a (1) code for this feature will include a distinction between male and female forms in at least some categories of second person independent pronouns. Pronouns that contrast in gender categories other than male/female sex are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between male and female forms for second person singular, but not second person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a male/female contrast in non-singular second person pronouns, but not in the singular pronouns, however such languages also satisfy the criteria for this feature.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB196 PRO2PMascFem	NA	pronoun	NA	6	PRO10	6PRO10

Gender/noun class assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the animacy of a noun is one of these factors for a given language.

That is, animacy must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Note that while (biological) sex is generally associated with animate referents, a gender system that makes a distinction between male and female is not necessarily sufficient to trigger a (1) here. A gender system in which animacy is a relevant factor will often make a distinction between human or animal referents and non-living referents, and animate status may be extended to culturally important non-living entities (e.g. mythological figures) or objects (e.g. celestial bodies).

In some languages, ideophones may have different morphosyntactic characteristics from other word classes (e.g. they have different morphology, or they have no morphology at all while other classes do; or they may be extremely free when it comes to word order, in comparison to other words). They may also feature sounds that are not present anywhere else in the language. Every language probably has ideophones, but not every language has a very well defined class of ideophones. If an author doesn't mention anything at all about ideophones in an otherwise relatively comprehensive grammar, this is probably because ideophones are not a very well defined category and this question can be coded as 0 in these cases.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB296 Ideophones	NA	nominal domain	NA	35	Ideo	35Ideo

Unsurprisingly, then, logophoric pronouns are commonly found in reported speech contexts. This question concerns the existence of an anaphoric pronoun that specifically receives its referential identity from the 3rd person subject of the superordinate clause in a reported speech construction (i.e. the speaker/thinker/feeler).

GB150	clausechain	Is there clause chaining?	verb, clause	predication	special construction	Hannah	Clause-chaining here is not just juxtapositioning of minimal clauses with no connectors, but chains of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single verb that usually (but not always) occurs in a final position. This complete verb is fully specified to provide the missing categories (e.g. TAM, argument marking) for the entire clause chain. Clause chains may be referred to as topic chains, or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single independent verb form, with several medial verbs that are dependent on it for full specification. Clause chains are generally used to describe simple sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved are often marked by special affixes.<CR><CR>Some analyses assert that medial verbs are coordinated, or at the very least not subordinated. However, it can be very difficult to determine this from descriptions and examples in grammars. Here we focus less on these syntactic distinctions and more on surface forms that fit the above description (sequences of stripped down verb forms dependent on a single verb for full specification), used for describing simple sequences of events.<CR><CR>In some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from serial verb constructions. Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that are typically inflected identically for TAM in a single clause, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of formally reduced clauses involving unmarked verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from verb compounding, in that the verbs involved in clause-chaining all carry full semantic weight (in contrast to the light verb of verb compounding) and different arguments (e.g. objects) may occur in each clause (whereas a verb compound takes a single set of arguments as a whole). In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a (?) may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB150 ClauseChain	Is there clause chaining?	clause	NA	26	Clause1	26Clause1

Exclude constructions that fall into the categories of verb compounding, clause-chaining, auxiliaries and serial verbs are excluded from the category of ""light-verb"". The verb needs to be sufficiently productive, it cannot only concern a few instances. It is uninteresting whether the predicating element is of nominal/verbal/other root. This means for example that what is described in the literature as ""co-verb constructions"" most likely are a subcategory of light verbs. It is also uninteresting for the definition of light-verbs whether or not the non-finite predicating element can occur outside the construction or not, both scenarios are acceptable.

GB401	NA	Is there a class of patient-labile verbs?	verb	valency change, verb classification	none	Alena	This quote from [Kulikov and Lavidas](http://www.fabula.org/actualites/typology-of-labile-verbs-focus-on-diachrony_27119.php) serves as a very good clarification. We are for this question only interested in P-labile verbs, not A-labile verbs.<CR><CR>_The term ‘labile' refers to verbs or verbal forms which can show valency alternation, i.e. changes in syntactic pattern, with no formal change in the verb. Very often (but not always) the term ‘labile' is only employed to refer to verbs (or verbal forms) which can be employed both transitively and intransitively, as in (1-2); some scholars use other, less widely accepted terms in this sense, such as ‘ambitransitive' (R. M. W. Dixon 1994) or ‘optionally transitive' (J. G. Miller 1993):_<CR><CR>_(1) English_<CR><CR> _a. John broke the vase_<CR><CR> _b. The vase broke_<CR><CR>_(2) Greek_<CR> _a.

GB129	closedclassv	Is there a notably small number, i.e. about 100 or less, of verb roots in the language?	verb	verb classification	inventory	Harald	In languages with a small number of verbs verb-noun or verb-adjective locutions are used instead, e.g., 'do meeting' for 'meet'. If a language has a small number of verbs in this sense, typically it will says that there is a closed class of verbs and a large part of the grammar will be devoted to the constructions whereby a verb from the closed class combines with an open-class item to form the predicate in most sentences. If the grammar never remarks on the size of the verbal inventory this almost always means that the language does not have a small number of verbs in the sense of the present question.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB129 FewVerbs	NA	verbal domain	NA	13	verb 1	13verb 1
GB127	positionialv	Are different posture verbs used obligatorily depending on an inanimate locatum's shape or position (e.g. 'to lie' vs. 'to stand')?	verb	verb classification, nominal classification, predication	suppletion, conjugation	Jakob	English would receive '0' here, as you can simply say that 'a bottle is on the table'. Dutch would be coded as '1', as you always have to specify whether an object 'stands' or 'lies' on the table (you cannot say that it 'is' on the table). Different configurations are possible, however (e.g. 'sit' vs. 'stand', 'hang' vs. 'lie' vs. 'stand'). Note that this feature does not concern morphological (or other overt) marking for position or shape, but really the use of different verbs for this purpose (in other words, suppletion). If the posture verbs are clearly dominant in frequency this is sufficient to count as 'obligatory' for the purpose of this question, even if non-posture alternatives are grammatical.	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB127 PostureVerbs	Are there positional (classificatory) verbs?	verbal domain	NA	24	Verb Randos 2	24Verb Randos 2

It is possible that there are more than one existential verbs making further distinctions, temporary versus permanent existence or a special marker for negative existence. Different positional verbs do not count here. The existential marker can be used for the expression of other functions, such as aspect, as long as it is not identical to the copula of identity or attribution. The existential element need not be a verb in the language in any other sense than being the existential ""verb"".

GB250	NA	Can predicative possession be expressed with a transitive 'habeo' verb?	verb, clause	verb classification, predicative possession, predication	auxiliary	Hedvig	"This question concerns predicative possession, i.e. finite clauses that express an ownership relation. Is there a verb that expresses predicative possession where the possessor is the subject, the possessum the object and the verb is finite and clearly transitive. The finite element in itself need not be clearly distinct from an existential or locational predicator, the main difference is the argument structure. Transitivity is a language-specific category that needs to be investigated separately to learn whether or not the construction is transitive. In case of languages where transitivity is hard to define it might be beneficial to compare to verbs of ""hold"" and ""grasp"". It is very likely that habeo-verb constructions arise from possessive constructions where the possessor is expressed as a topic (see feature 255).<CR><CR>This is known as ""have-possessive"" in the work of Stassen."	1: present, 0: absent	NA	GB250 PredPOSSHabeo	NA	nominal domain	NA	8	AD POSS1	8AD POSS1
