GB020	Are there definite or specific articles?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	"An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity, (in)definiteness and information status (new or given status). Sometimes these notions of specificity, definiteness and information status are summed up in the term identifiability. Articles cannot occur independently, though they might be homophonous with pronouns or numerals that can. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not to be similar in formal expression or position.

A formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone.
Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm where there are markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often obligatory in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning 'a certain'. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers."	article, NP, demonstrative	definiteness, deixis	declension, particle, paradigm	Jay/Jeremy	"An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity, (in)definiteness and information status (new or given status).

Coder’s comment: ‘Well it is common for a free pronoun to be the first element of the clause and a coreferent nominal may follow the verb (see (89b), p.369). However, Crowley describes this construction as an afterthought construction in which case these are not discontinuous NPs.

GB027	Are nominal conjunction and comitative expressed by different elements?	1: present, 0: absent					Is there a difference between the marking of NP coordination ('John and Mary went to market') and the marking of comitative phrases ('John with Mary went to market')? This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appendixed text of the grammar should reveal this (to a certain extent). In some languages the only way to do nominal coordination is with a comitative phrase, i.e., the only way to say X and Y is to say X with Y. This feature aims to capture such languages (which, as they have no difference between coordination and comitatives for nouns, get a 0). To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating check for case marking, agreement etc. For example, if X is the element in question and in the dative you get 'John-DAT X Mary-DAT' then X is likely coordinating, while if you get John-DAT X Mary then X is likely comitative. Or with agreement, if you get 'John X Mary verb-PL' rather than 'John X Mary verb-SG' (just like 'John X suitcase verb-SG') then that suggests X is likely coordinating.	adposition, case marker, NP	argument marking, oblique, conjunction, coordination, case marking, comitative	declension, flagging	Hedvig	Is there a difference between the marking of NP coordination ('John and Mary went to market') and the marking of comitative phrases ('John with Mary went to market')?

Examples  **Turkish** used to be a language with only comitatives for NP coordination namely the -le/la marker as in 'Mary-le John' but Modern Turkish also has the borrowed ve 'and' so one can now also 'John ve Mary'.

A plural pronoun that is unmarked for clusivity can be derived from the polite or familiar first person pronouns with a prefix, but the inclusive first person is inherently plural. There is no first person plural pro-form that is marked for exclusivity. The existence of an inclusive form is sufficient to trigger a (1) and the lack of an exclusive form has no impact on this.    **Yongbei Zhuang** (ISO 639-3: zyb, Glottocode: yong1276)    Table 9.3.5: First person    | Singular | Plural (excl.) | Plural (incl.) |  | --- | --- | --- |  |ku | tuo, po tu | lau’ |    (Luo 2008: 327)    Coded by Jeremy as 1.

GB030	Is there a gender distinction in independent 3rd person pronouns?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	This question targets the existence of a gender distinction in independent 3rd person anaphoric forms, which includes pronouns and also demonstratives. This distinction is often one of natural gender (masc./fem), but it could be animacy as well (see Corbett 1991 for further discussion of gender). For languages with no 3rd person independent pronouns a gender distinction in demonstratives would trigger a (1) here. If pronouns with inanimate referents agree with the gender/noun class of that inanimate noun that will also suffice for (1) here. If a language has a gender distinction for 3rd person pronouns but not for demonstratives, this is also sufficient for a (1) in this category.	pronoun	person, number, gender	declension, paradigm	Hannah	This question targets the existence of a gender distinction in independent 3rd person anaphoric forms, which includes pronouns and also demonstratives. This distinction is often one of natural gender (masc./fem), but it could be animacy as well (see Corbett 1991 for further discussion of gender).

If pronouns with inanimate referents agree with the gender/noun class of that inanimate noun that will also suffice for (1) here. If a language has a gender distinction for 3rd person pronouns but not for demonstratives, this is also sufficient for a (1) in this category.     Procedure  1. If there are grammaticalised  independent pronouns which specify sex (masculine or feminine) or animacy, or agree with the gender/nounclass of the noun, code 1.  2. If there are no 3rd person demonstratives that specify sex/gender/nounclass but there are demonstratives that specify gender, code 1.  3. If neither independent 3rd person forms nor demonstratives are marked for gender, code 0.     Examples    **Kuot** (ISO 639-3: kto, Glottolog: kuot1243)    Kuot has no 3rd person pronouns (Lindstr&246;m 2002, 132).

If the number marker is fused with another marker and there is uncertainty - contact patron through GitHub-issues     Examples  **Akan** (ISO 639-3: aka, Glottocode: akan1250)     Akan has a noun class system marked by prefixes on nouns that distinguishes between singular and plural number. There are 6 noun classes. These noun classes prefixes mark number as well as noun class and are bound to the noun. _o/ɔ-_ is the prefix for noun class 1 which is singular, and _a/e-_ for noun class 6 which is plural. Here is an example with the stem for angel -_bɔfo_  (Osam 1994:120). This is an example of code 1 for GB042.     | | singular | plural |   | ---- |  ---- |----------- |   |angel| _ɔ-bɔfo_ | _a-bɔfo_ |      **Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottocode: swed1254)    Swedish has suffixes for plural number, but singular is not regularly marked. However, there are some instances where the possibility to analyse certain nouns as having a singular suffix arises. For example, the word for boy - _pojke_-    (Skirgård, p.c.)    | | singular | plural |   |-------- | ---- | ----------- |   | orange | _apelsin_ | _apelsiner_ |   | boy | _pojke_ | _pojkar_ |     However, Swedish is an example of code 0 for this feature. Even if there are some nouns that could be analysed as having singular marking, it is not a regular productive pattern. The productive marking of singular number in Swedish is by the absence of the plural-suffix - and that does not lead to a 1 in GB042.     Further reading  * Corbett, Greville 2000. Number.

Their grammatical gender is semantically linked to their natural (biological) gender. In some cases, the semantic link is lexically defined (sex-differentiable); thus the grammatical gender does not vary (e.g., boy, mother, rooster, etc.). However, for words like mòosó “cow” and námá “child”, the natural gender is understood to be male when a masculine direct object suffix is used, and female when the feminine direct object suffix is used, i.e., they are “common-gender nouns” (Corbett 1991:34, 181).' (Lovestrand 2012: 71)    The semantic association between nouns whose gender is invariant and whose referents are semantically associated with particular biological sexes (*mother*, *rooster*) is what triggers the 1 code for Barein. The ""common-gender"" nouns, for which gender agreement indicates the gender of the individual(s) being referred to (rather than a biological sex associated with the general semantics of the noun) are also an example of sex playing a role in the gender system, but this is not necessary for the 1 designation.

Procedure  1.

Examples    **Luise&241;o** (ISO 639-3: lui, Glottolog: luis1253)    Luise&241;o possessive constructions are formed by attaching a possessive pronominal prefix (e.g. meaning *my*, *your*, etc.) to the possessed noun. A suffix -ki is also attached to the possessed noun when the relationship between possessor and possessed is alienable: *my sinew* (in my body) = no-ta&817;; *my sinew* (for the bow I am making) = no-ta&817;-ki (Grune 1997: 4).

Coding should take into consideration only those possession constructions that are pragmatically unmarked (i.e. not focus). This feature applies to both pronominal and nominal possessors.       Procedure  1. In the pragmatically unmarked order, if the possessor precedes the possessum, code 1.  2. In the pragmatically unmarked order, if the possessor follows the possessum, code 2.  3. If both occur, for example if some possessed nouns precede and some follow, or there is a free choice, then code 3.    TO DO (from Jeremy) Please clarify whether suffixes on possessed nouns count.       Examples  **Nanti** (ISO 639-3: cox, Glottolog: nant1250)    i- banko Ihonira    3msg- house pers.name    *Ihonira's house*    irashi i- banko    3msg.poss 3msg- house    *his house*    Inalienable possession in Nanti is expressed by a prefix on the possessed noun, which indicates the person, number, gender of the possessor. A nominal possessor or possessive pronoun may also be included in the phrase. Nominal possessors follow the possessed noun in unmarked constructions, but may appear to the left of the possessum when they are in contrastive focus. Pronominal possessors occur to the left of possessed nouns. Alienable possession uses the same prefixes as inalienable possession, but also includes an alienable possession suffix on the possessed noun. Nanti would be coded 3. In pragmatically unmarked possessive constructions with nominal possessors, the possessor noun follows the possessed noun. The focus construction in which a possessor nominal occurs before the possessed noun does not trigger a 3 here. However, the fact that pronominal possessors precede possessed nouns in the relevant pragmatically unmarked construction (and, in fact, always when there is an independent possessive pronoun) means that both orders are present in unmarked constructions. This triggers a 3 code.    (Michael 2012: 151-152)    **Southeastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: pom, Glottolog: sout2982)    Both alienable and inalienable possession in Southeastern Pomo involve a construction where the possessor precedes the possessed noun.    hayut xin    hayu-it xin    dog-POSS name    *the dog's name*    bt&803;edit xal    bt&803;ed-it xal    woman-POSS arm    *the woman's arm*    hayutbaq ca    hayu-it-baq ca    dog-POSS-ALIEN house    *the dog's house*    &577;uyitbaq ca    &577;uyi-it-baq ca    3s-POSS-ALIEN house    *his house*    (Moshinsky 1974: 95)    Southeastern Pomo would be coded 1, since only this one order occurs.    **Nzadi** (Glottolog: nzad1234)    The possessor noun or possessive pronoun follows the possessed noun in Nzadi. For some classes of possessed nouns, a genitive linker /&233;/ also occurs before the possessor.    mw&224;&225;n m&464;`    child my    *my child*    &464;g&596;m mw&224;&225;n    drum child    *the child's drum*    oky&225; &233; &464;&769;k&234;m    tail GL monkey    *the monkey's tail*    (Crane et all 2011: 77-83)    Nzadi would be coded 2, since the possessor always follows the possessed noun in pragmatically unmarked constructions.

Mention this in the comment column.     Examples    **Warrongo** (ISO 639-3: wrg, Glottolog: waru1264)    Warrongo has case markers on every element of the NP (Tsunoda 2011: 342ff):    ```  ngali nyina-ya jarribara-ngga yamba-ngga  1DU.NOM sit-IMP good-LOC camp-LOC  'Let's sit down in the good camp.'  (Tsunoda 2011: 343)  ```    **Zuni** (ISO 639-3: zun, Glottolog: zuni1245)    Zuni has a directional enclitic _-kʷin_ and a locative enclitic _-ʔan_. No clear examples are given where we can check whether they really attach to the end of the noun phrase or just to the noun: (my glosses)     ```  kalapa-kʷin  Gallup-DIR  '(He went) to Gallup'  Newman (1965: 66)    kʔakʷe-'w-an  house-PL-LOC  '(We stayed) at their houses'  Newman (1965: 66)  ```    **Ndam** (ISO 639-3: ndm, Glottolog: ndam1251)    In Ndam, the locative of disyllabic nouns with mid-mid melody is formed by lowering the melody to low-low. low-low nouns are turned into locatives by changing their melody to low-high (Bross 1988: 57-58):    ```  būgō 'house' → bùgò 'in the house'  gūjʌ̄n 'my stomach' → gùjʌ̀n 'in my stomach'  gə̀lè 'concession' → gə̀lé 'in the concession'  ```    **Fore** (ISO 639-3: for, Glottolog: fore1270)    Fore marks allative case by means of the enclitic _=ti_ (Scott 1978: 104, 109-111):    ```  pi nkáu='i wa-y-e  that place=ALL go-he-INDIC  'He goes to that place.'  (Scott 1978: 109; glosses and transcription slightly adapted and clitic mark added)  ```  **Holoholo** (ISO 639-3: hoo, Glottolog: holo1240)    Various Bantu languages have one or more 'locative noun classes', which qualify as oblique case markers for the purposes of Grambank. Holoholo is a good example, having three 'locative' noun class 'prefixes' (classes 16, 17, 18 in Coupez 1955: 36, 38), which are in fact proclitics (they only attach to the noun, which is the first element of the noun phrase) and thus count as both prepositions and oblique case markers here.    ```  heelungu  ha-lungu  LOC-country  'In the country.'    kwilungu  ku-lungu  LOC-country  'Close to the country.'    mwilungu  mu-lungu  LOC-country  'In the country.'  ```    **Hokkaido Ainu** (ISO 639-3: ain, Glottolog: ainu1240)    Hokkaido Ainu has no morphological cases whatsoever, and is coded 0.

Lukas (1936: 56) attests two postpositions, temporal *ká* and *fa* 'except'. He gives only the following examples, from which it is impossible to check whether they are postpositions or suffixes, but as there is no evidence that Lukas' definition of postposition conflicts with ours elsewhere, this is not considered a problem.    ```  fázàr ká  early.morning TEMP  'In the early morning.'    méa ɣo-ne zumi-a-tan šēn kii fa  people city-PROX food-GEN-3PL have.not fish except  'The people of this city have no food but fish.'    (my glosses; ɣo-ne is erroneously represented as ro-ne in the original example)  ```    **Kwini** (ISO 639-3: gww, Glottolog: kwin1241)    In Kwini, case relations are marked with bound morphemes (in a morphosyntactic sense, but not in a phonological sense) that are at times attached to the end of the noun phrase, where they qualify as enclitics and thus postpositions, and at other times attached to the initial word of the noun phrase, where they qualify as inpositions (McGregor 1993: 36-41). Because they behave as postpositions at least in some cases, Kwini is coded 1 for the purpose of Grambank. The following is a list of postpositions found in Kwini, adopted from McGregor (1993: 36):    ```  ngindalu LOC(ative)  gu DAT(ive)  yanga ABL(ative)  we PURP(osive)  nyine INST(rumental)  gude COMIT(ative)  nangga GEN(itive)  miya DU(al)  ```    **Siwi** (ISO 639-3: siz, Glottolog: siwi1239)    Souag (2010: 306) states that ""Siwi (...) is exclusively prepositional"", which is sufficient to code it 0.    **Baharna Arabic** (ISO 639-3: abv, Glottolog: baha1259)    In a sketch of Baharna Arabic, Holes (2006:241-255) lists plenty of prepositions, but no postpositions.

It can be hard to distinguish future tense from different modal categories, after all if something is in the future it has not yet occurred and can be construed as something wished for, planned, intended etc rather than actually on the concrete timeline of events. This is why it's necessary to take extra notice on sections on mood, especially irrealis, when coding for future tense.

If a language only has future tense under negation, this does not count for this feature. It needs to be present for affirmation as well. [This was brought up in this issue thread.](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/issues/62). The reason for this is that conditions such as only under negation are likely to give rise to quite different analysis by different linguists (hence hard to ensure comparability) and might also be overlooked.

GB086	Is a morphological distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect available on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	"This feature is concerned with bound marking of imperfective/perfective grammatical aspects. These categories could go by the name of punctual/continuous, preterit/progressive etc. The answer could be yes even if it's only one that is overtly marked, i.e. if imperfective is by affix and perfective by auxiliary for example. Please take notice that GB310 and GB86 are not covering exactly the same functions, they cover more grammatical aspects than punctual/continuous. If this marking is only relevant for a small subset of verbs, alert patron and discuss.

If this distinction is only available in some TAM-conditions, this counts as well. For example, if there isn't an aspectual distinction in the past but only in the present, this still triggers a '1'."	verb	TAM, aspect	conjugation	Hedvig	"This feature is concerned with bound marking of imperfective/perfective grammatical aspects. These categories could go by the name of punctual/continuous, preterit/progressive etc. The answer could be ""yes"" even if it's only one that is overtly marked, i.e. if imperfective is by affix and perfective by auxiliary for example.

If this is only true for a small set of verbs, alert patron and discuss (this is because suppletion can apply on small sets in a way that is not intended to be covered by this feature).  3. If only one of the aspects is overly marked, code 1  4. If there is no marking of aspect at all, code 0  5. If it is not possible to tease apart present tense and imperfective, and that is the only possible relevant construction in the language for this feature, code as ""?"".     Examples  **Chukchii** (ISO 639-3: ckt, Glottocode: chuk1273)    In Chukchii, there is aspectual marking on the verb that distinguishes progressive aspect from a neutral aspect. The suffix differs between men's and women's language (_-rkə_ / _-ccə) and varies somewhat with phonological context. Dunn(1999:176, 185) gives the examples below. Chukchii is coded as a 1 for this feature.    ||non-fut | future |   |-------- | ---- | ----------- |  Neutral aspect | _jetɣʔi_  ’she came’ | _rejetɣʔe_  ’she will come’ |  Progressive aspect | _jetərkən/jetəccən_  ’she is coming’ | _rejetərkən/rejetəccən_  ’she will be coming’ |       Further reading  * Comrie, Bernard. 1985.

GB089	Can the S argument be indexed by a suffix/enclitic on the verb in the simple independent clause?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	Is there a phonologically bound S argument [index](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/indexing) that follows its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a suffix or an enclitic)?	verb, index	argument marking, core arguments, person, number, gender	conjugation, indexing, suffixation	Alena	"Is there a phonologically bound S argument [index](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/indexing) that follows its verbal host (i.e. attaches to it as a suffix or an enclitic)?     Procedure  1. Code 1 if there is an element indexing/cross-referencing the S argument and phonologically bound to the verb or auxiliary verb. The index needs to follow the verbal host it is bound to.  2. If there is some variation in the position of marking of the S argument (e.g. most verbs code the S argument with a suffix, but a couple use a prefix) consider only the major pattern. If it is impossible to identify the major pattern, code all main patterns (this might be the case in the so-called split-S/stative-active languages).  3. If the verb shows overt agreement only with some arguments (e.g. only with animate arguments or only with 3rd person singular arguments, as the English _-s_ in _he go-es_ vs. _we go_), still code as 1. The question aims to capture which of the three arguments S, A, and P trigger indexing/agreement and not how much indexing/agreement there is.     Examples    **Example 1: Korowai** (khe/koro1312; van Enk and de Vries 1997: 87-90, 183)    Code as 1 (the fact that there are zero morphemes and syncretism of 2nd and 3rd person does not matter)    Independent verb forms express status, subject person-number, mood, and aspect. They are used in independent (final) clauses, subordinate clauses, and chained (medial) clauses. Dependent verb forms do not express subject person and number.    The person-number suffixes in the realis are as follows:    * 1SG _-le_/_-nde_  * 1PL _-le_/_-te_/_-nde_  * 2/3SG zero/_-l_  * 2/3PL _-te(l)_    This same set is used with small variations for the other statuses, moods, and aspects. Intentional and imperative mood take an entirely different set of person-number endings, distinguishing second from third person in both singular and plural. The 'zero' ending (stem-only form) is the usual non-1SG realis form.    ```  ye   khén-telo-do          yakhatimekho  he   angry-be.3SG.REAL-DS  renounce.3SG.REAL  'He went angry and she renounced.'  ```    **Example 2:** Bukiyip (ape/buki1249; Conrad and Wogiga 1991: 25–33)    Code as 0.     Argument indexes (person-number-gender) vary depending on the verb class. There are two intransitive classes:    - Class 5 (intr., relatively large in number): SBJ-V-(BEN/DIR)  - Class 6 (intr., small number of stative verbs): V-OBJ    For coding one considers only the major pattern (here Class 5 with suffixes, as in (a)), Class 6 with S suffixes from the object suffixes paradigm, as in (b), is a minor pattern and should be ignored, so Bukiyip is coded as 0.    ```  (a) Major pattern:      Ny-é-nak-moli         malmu?      2SG.SBJ-REAL-go-come  why      'Why did you come?'

This pattern includes some of the cases referred to as (alignment) split in the literature.   Polarity (i.e. positive vs. negative distinction) does not count as a TAM category.   Absence of overt indexing in the imperative does not count here either.     Procedure  1. Consider the flagging patterns of the language (coded in [GB408](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB408), [GB409](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB409), and [GB410](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB410)). Is there any variation in the flagging of either S, A, or P which is determined by TAM categories (e.g. certain cases are used only in the perfective but not in the imperfective)? Code ""1"". Specifically look for such terms as *split ergative/ergativity* and *differential subject marking*.  2. Consider the indexing patterns of the language (coded in (coded in [GB089](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB089)–[GB094](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB409)).

Code 1 both for difference in the form of the respective markers in case it result in different alignment patterns as well as for variation in the position of indexes (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic) even if the overall alignment pattern remains the same.  2. Code 0 if TAM results in merely different allomorphs of person/number indexes in the same position, so that both the overall alignment pattern and the position of markers remain the same. For the purposes of this question, the alternation between zero and overt indexes in some TAM does not count (code as 0).  3. Code 0 if there is no variation in indexing or flagging according to TAM.      Examples    **Code 1: Itzá (itz/itza1241; Mayan; Guatemala; Hofling and Tesucún 2000: 357)**    A transitive verb indexes the A argument by means of the so-called ‘Set A’ **prefixes**, e.g. *inw-* ‘1sA’ in (a) and (b), and with the P argument by means of the ‘Set B’ **suffixes**, e.g. *-ech* ‘2sP’ in the same example:    ```  Aspect: incompletive  k-inw-il-ik-ech.  INCOMPL-1sA-see-INCOMPL.TR-2sP  ‘I see you.’    Aspect: completive  t-inw-il-ik-ech.  COMPL-1sA-see-COMPL.TR-2sP  ‘I saw you.’  ```    With intransitive verbs both Set A and Set B affixes can occur. In this case the distribution is conditioned by the aspect of the clause (called ‘status’ in Mayan linguistics). The set A person markers are used in the non-completive aspect, e.g. *inw-* ‘1sA’ in (c), whereas the B markers are used in the completive aspect, e.g. *-ech* ‘2sP’ in (d):    ```  Aspect: incompletive  k-inw-em-el.

In Series II (Aorist) the A argument is in the narrative case (aka ergative), e.g. *deda-m* ‘mother-NARR’ in (b), the P  argument is in the nominative, e.g *tavis-i švil-i* ‘self.GEN-NOM child-NOM’ in (b).    ```  Series I (Present)  a. deda       bans             tavis    švil-s.     mother.NOM she.bathes.him.I self.GEN child-DAT     ‘The mother is bathing her child.’       Series II (Aorist)  b. deda-m       dabana             tavis-i       švil-i.     mother-NARR  she.bathed.him.II  self.GEN-NOM  child-NOM     ‘The mother bathed her child.’  ```     Further reading  Dixon, R.M.W. 1994. *Ergativity*.

The class of unergative verbs contains quite a few simple verbs, such as *dirdiratu* 'glimmer', *botatu* 'bounce', *bozkatu* 'vote', *gogoetatu* 'meditate', *irakin* 'boil', *iraun* 'persist', *bazkaldu* 'have dinner', *afaldu* 'have supper', and *dimititu* 'resign' (Hualde 2003: 388–389). Moreover, there is a large class of unergative [complex predicates (or light verb constructions)](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB123), which are monovalent, they are composed of a bare noun and a verb indicating action: egin 'do', as in (c).   ```  a.

German is coded ""0"" because this verb class does not qualify as substantially large. Many other languages (if not every language) have small classes of predicates with marking patterns deviating from the one major pattern.    **Osage** (osa/osag1243; Siouan; Pustet 2002)    Code ""1""    Osage transitive verbs index both A and P arguments, as in (a):    ```  ǫ-tha-nǫk̩ˀǫ  aSGP-2sgA-hear  'You hear/heard me.' (Wolff 1952:234, as in Pustet 2002: 391)  ```    Around 70% of intransitive verbs use the same indexes to mark the S argument as the ones used for the A argument, as in (b), whereas the remaining 30% of intransitive verbs (still a substantial amount) use the indexes identical to the ones used for the P arguments. gether,these two paradigmsform coding patternA in Osage. There seems to be a semantic basis for the formal contrast between the indexing patterns with A and P prefixes.

This pattern includes cases referred to as person-based (alignment) split and hierarchical alignment in the literature.      Procedure  1. Consider whether there are any differences in the form of the argument indexes on the verb (coded in [GB089](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB089)–[GB094](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB094)) related to the person of arguments (1st vs. 2nd vs. 3rd). If there is some variation, code 1 if it either results in different alignment patterns or if the position of indexes differs (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic) even if the overall alignment pattern remains the same.  2. Code 1 if case/adposition marking of S, A, or P arguments (coded in [GB408](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB408), [GB409](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB409), and [GB410](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB410)) varies according to person of the marked argument. If there is some variation, code 1 if it either results in different alignment patterns or if the position of indexes differs (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic).  3. The alternation between zero marking for some persons and overt marking for other persons does not suffice for 1.  4. Code 0 if there is no variation in indexing or flagging according to person, even if other referential properties of arguments matter, such as animacy, number, pronominal vs. nominal status.  5. Code 0 if person triggers merely different overt allomorphs of flagging or indexing, so that the overall alignment pattern remains the same.     Examples  **Code 1: English** (eng/stan1293)  The alignment pattern of English case marking is conditioned by person, number and nominal/pronominal distinction. The first person (singular an plural) distinguishes S/A from P, as in (a), whereas the case marking of the second person pronouns shows neutral alignment, as in (b).    (a) First person:    ***I*** *smiled.* (S)    ***I*** *have read this book.* (A)    *He saw ***me***.* (P)    (b) Second person:    ***You*** *smiled.* (S)    ***You*** *have read this book.* (A)    *I saw ***you***.* (P)      **Code 1: Kirmanjki** (kiu/kirm1248; Selcan 1998)  Kirmanjiki shows variations in case marking of core participants based on a number of factors: animacy, noun vs. pronoun, person distinctions and [TAM (GN095)](https://github.com/glottobank/Grambank/wiki/GB095).  In non-past tenses, S, A and nominal inanimate Ps, as well as some pronominal P arguments (1pl, 2pl) are in the direct case.   Animate nominal Ps, as well as 1sg, 2sg, 3sg and 3pl pronominal P are in the oblique case.   This pattern of case marking yields neutral alignment for inanimate nouns, as well as for 1 pl and 2 pl pronouns, and accusative alignment for animate nouns, as well as for 1sg, 2sg and 3sg/pl pronouns.   Because person is one of the factors, the language is coded as 1.     Further reading  Dixon, R.M.W. 1994. Ergativity.

This need not be the default productive way of intransitivizing nouns, but the process must be productive. The incorporated noun is semantically the direct object of the verb.

Code 1 if there is there is a strategy for intransitivizing verbs that either binds a bare object nominal morphologically to the verb, or requires a bare object nominal to be positioned immediately adjacent to the verb.  2. Code 0 if the nominal involved in this construction is not obligatorily bare, or if it does not express the semantic object of the verb.  3.

Procedure  1. Code 1 if verb roots (not verb morphology) which express location (such as *is* in *the book is on the table*) also encode the posture ('lie', 'stand', 'sit', 'hang', e.g. ‘the book lies on the table’ = ‘the book is on the table’), and if there is no frequently used more general way of encoding location.  2. Code 0 if expressions of location do not also obligatorily encode posture. A look at texts and examples should give you an idea of this.  3. Code ? if you cannot find clear examples of locational predication.     Examples    **Meyah** (ISO 639-3: mej, Glottolog: meya1236)    In Meyah, different positional verbs are obligatorily used to predicate the existence and location of (a) humans, (b) animals, trees, corn stalks, and houses, and (c) snakes, ants, rocks, yams, water, rainbows. Humans are considered to 'sit' (*eker*). Members of category (b), which includes animals and inanimate objects that have legs, are considered to 'stand' (*ot*). Members of category (c), which have in common that they don't have any legs, are considered to 'lie' (*ah*) (Gravelle 2004: 223). Some examples are:    ```  (a) Humans sit:    Idu bera en-eker gu mei  Idu TOP DUR-sit in water  'Who is in the water?'    (b) Nonhuman leg-possessing entities stand:    Mega mos ongga en-ot gij Iskuruk  tree mos REL DUR-stand in Iskuruk  'The mos tree that is in Iskuruk village...'    (c) Legless entities lie    Ineymes en-ah gu monuh Mandacan  Ineymes Dur-lie.down at place Mandacan  'Ineymes village is in the Mandacan area.'    (Gravelle 2004: 224)  ```    **Standard Dutch** (ISO 639-3: nld, Glottolog: dutc1256)    In Standard Dutch, there is a composite generic verb *zich bevinden* which can be used to specify the location of an entity without indicating its posture. It is, however, rarely used in day-to-day speech, and usually either _staan_ 'to stand' or *liggen* 'to lie' is used when referring to something's location. Dutch gets a 1 for this feature.    ```  (a) A bottle 'stands':    De fles staa-t in de kamer hier-naast.  DEF bottle stand-3SG in DEF room here-beside   'The bottle is in the room next door.'    (b) A ball 'lies':    De bal lig-t in de kamer hier-naast.  DEF ball lie-3SG in DEF room here-beside   'The ball is in the room next door.'  ```    **Hatam** (ISO 639-3: had, Glottolog: hata1243)    Hatam has a generic verb *jo* which can be used to refer to an entity's location without specifying the posture of that entity. Of course, there are also posture verbs, but they are not used obligatorily, or by default, in locative predication constructions. Notably, in the examples, posture verbs are only used for animate entities. Hatam is coded 0.    ```  Use of the generic verb 'jo':    Lampu jo gau meja (dip).  lamp be above table top  'The lamp is above the table.'    Ni-mmeng mui jo tai biei.  3SG-leaf dry be around tree  'There are dry leaves (directly) around the tree.'    Srad jo ghai dani.  book be around me  'The books are scattered around me.'

(Reesink 1999: 63)  ```    **English** (ISO 639-3: eng, Glottolog: stan1293)    English is like Hatam, in that location of inanimate entities is usually specified with *to be*, and not with a posture verb, although English also has posture verbs such as *lie*, *stand*, *sit* and *hang*.

GB137	Can standard negation be marked clause-finally?	1: present, 0: absent					This feature refers to Standard Negation (SN), i.e. the construction that marks negation of dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that SN is used for other kinds of negation as well, this is a necessary requirement but not exhaustive. The position clause-final includes suffixes on verbs in verb-final clauses, even if it isn't indeed the very last suffix on the verb. Prefixes on clause-final verbs do not count as clause-final negation. If the negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-final, this is sufficient to count as clause-final negation and trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we're concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order, i.e. not cases of argument omission or marked focus constructions.	particle, clause, verb	TAM, negation	conjugation, word order, particle	Hannah	"This feature refers to Standard Negation (SN), i.e. the construction that marks negation of dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood.

Such uncontrolled predicates may be found in special constructions, different case frames ('sleep hits me', 'cramp footgrabs me'), they may form a special conjugation class of verbs or adjectives, there may be a dedicated (modal) marker for control vs. non-control, etc. The existence of verbal derivations such as passive or causative does not count as 1 here.	clause, verb, adjective, noun, case marker, NP	control, argument marking, core, oblique, verb classification	special construction, flagging, indexing, conjugation, declension	Jakob	"In a number of languages, predicates referring to uncontrolled events or states are encoded differently from those that refer to controlled events.

Code ? if nothing on the topic is said and there is not enough data to decide on whether such constructions may exist or not.     Examples    **Siwai** (ISO 639-3: siw, Glottolog: siwa1245)    Siwai has a lexical split in its alignment system. Intransitive-only verbs can be classified according to the kind of suffixal index they take. There are verbs that take so-called ""SO"" suffixes, which are made up of an O index + _-u_. In other words, the single argument of SO-verbs is coded the same as a patient in transitive verbs. In another class of intransitive verbs, which take ""SA"" suffixes, the single argument is coded the same as an agent in transitive verbs (Onishi 1994: 398, 401ff). Experiencers, which have no control over the events that happen to them, are coded differently from agents, which do have control over the action that is performed.    ```  Examples of SO-verbs (uncontrolled states)    haa- 'to want, to agree'  hingh- 'to decay'  hunok- 'to become/be full in stomach'  kamann- 'to feel cold'  kipi'tak 'to hiccup'    nii tuu haa-mu-u-ng  I water want-1SO-NRPAST-M  'I want water'    Onishi (1994: 401-402)  ```    ```  Examples of SA-verbs (controlled actions)    kumar- 'to laugh'  mon- 'to look'  pu'j- 'to shout'  konn- 'to walk'  nok- 'to say'    Onishi (1994: 403)  ```    **Nuu-chah-nulth** (ISO 639-3: nuk, Glottolog: nuuc1236)    Nuu-chah-nulth has a specialized future tense clitic _ʔaːqtɬ_, called 'intentive' by Davidson (2002: 305), that implies that the agent of an action has control over the event.    ```  ts'axʷ-ʃitɬ=ʔaːqtɬ=qa'=s  spear-PERF=INTENT=SUBOR=1sg  'And I am going to spear him.'  Davidson (2002: 305)  ```    **Khwarshi-Inkhoqwari** (ISO 639-3: khv, Glottolog: khva1239)    In Khwarshi-Inkhoqwari there is an 'accidental' marker for verbs, *l*, that indicates that an action is not voluntary and not controlled. Involuntary agents are marked with the contessive case. The verb for 'to blow', for example, can be coded as being controlled _puɬ-a_ or uncontrolled _puɬ-l-a_ (Khalilova 2009: 267).

GB147	Is there a morphological passive marked on the lexical verb?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	Passivization is a detransitivizing operation that takes a transitive clause ('The dog bites the man.') and turns it into an intransitive one by promoting the P argument ('the man') to morphosyntactic S function.

Examples    **Kuku Yalanji** (ISO 639-3: gvn, Glottolog: kuku1273)    Kuku Yalanji is an example of a language with ergative alignment for nouns that features antipassive marking. As shown in the example below, the antipassive is formed with the suffix *-ji*. In the antipassive clause the former ergative argument in the active clause ('the man', A) becomes absolutive (S). The former absolutive argument (O) becomes an oblique, locative argument in the antipassive clause.    ```  Active clause:  nyulu dingkar-angka minya nuka-ny  3sg.NOM(A) man-ERG:pt(A) meat.ABS(O) eat-PAST  'The man ate meat.'  (Patz 2002: 152)    Antipassive clause:  nyulu dingkar minya-nga nuka-ji-ny  3sg.NOM(S) man.ABS(S) meat-LOC eat-ANTI-PAST  'The man had a good feed of meat (he wasted nothing.)  (Patz 2002: 152)  ```    At the same time, the antipassive marker in Kuku Yalanji exemplifies how such markers often also fulfill other detransitivizing functions in languages such as passivization.    ```  Passive clause:  warru (yaburr-undu) bayka-ji-ny  yg.man.ABS(S) shark-LOC:pt bite-PASS-PAST  'The young man was bitten (by a shark).  (Patz 2002: 148)  ```  **Cilubà** (ISO 639-3: abc, Glottolog: luba1249)    Cilubà is an example of an accusative language without core case flags that has an antipassive marker, *angan*. The typical function of the antipassive in Cilubà is to indicate a non-punctual (e.g. a custom or habit) action by which a non-identifiable patient is affected, or different patients, the identity of which is not immediately relevant in the discourse situation, are affected (Dom, Bostoen & Segerer 2015).     ```  Active:  Mù-sàlaayì u-di ù-lu-a mu-lwishì  NP1-solfier PC1-PRS SC1-fight-FV NP1-enemy  'The soldier who is fighting the enemy.'

GB149	Is there a morphologically marked inverse on verbs?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	Inverse systems (as defined in this project) are based on an animacy, person, or topicality hierarchy (e.g. first/second person > third person > cats > dogs > other animals > inanimates). Languages can have markers on transitive verbs that indicate whether the agent(-like argument) of the clause is higher on this hierarchy than the patient(-like argument) [= direct marker], or whether the reverse is true, i.e. that the patient outranks the agent on the hierarchy [= inverse marker]. An example would be 'man INV-bite dog' to mean 'the dog bit the man'. Note that in some languages, there are portmanteau morphemes that both function as a person index on verbs and as direct/inverse markers, so different person indexes are used based on where the agent and patient are located relative to each other on the hierarchy.

It indicates that the patient of a clause outranks the agent of the clause on the following topicality hierarchy: 1SG/2 > 3/1PL. It also seems to be used when both the agent and patient are third person.    ```  Kën a-y-ïkïtï-yaj / amën y-^-ḯkïtï-yaj.  an.invis 2-inv-cut-pperf1 2sg inv-di-cut-pperf1  ‘He/she cut you.’  ```    **Cherokee** (ISO 639-3: chr, Glottolog: cher1273)    In Cherokee, there are two sets of prefixes, a 'direct' one and an 'inverse' one.

GB150	Is there clause chaining?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	"Clause-chaining here is not just juxtapositioning of minimal clauses with no connectors, but chains of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single verb that usually (but not always) occurs in a final position. This complete verb is fully specified to provide the missing categories (e.g. TAM, argument marking) for the entire clause chain. Clause chains may be referred to as topic chains, or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single independent verb form, with several medial verbs that are dependent on it for full specification. Clause chains are generally used to describe simple sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved are often marked by special affixes.

Some analyses assert that medial verbs are coordinated, or at the very least not subordinated. However, it can be very difficult to determine this from descriptions and examples in grammars. Here we focus less on these syntactic distinctions and more on surface forms that fit the above description (sequences of stripped down verb forms dependent on a single verb for full specification), used for describing simple sequences of events.

In some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from serial verb constructions. Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that are typically inflected identically for TAM in a single clause, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of formally reduced clauses involving unmarked verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from verb compounding, in that the verbs involved in clause-chaining all carry full semantic weight (in contrast to the light verb of verb compounding) and different arguments (e.g. objects) may occur in each clause (whereas a verb compound takes a single set of arguments as a whole).

If sequential meaning is a secondary function of an imperfective aspect this does not count; it must be indicated by a devoted marker.

If sequential meaning is a secondary function of an imperfective aspect this does not count; it must be indicated by a devoted marker. The language does not need to express both sequential and simultaneous temporal relationships overtly; one marker devoted to either function will do.     Procedure  1. If there is a marker in the verbal morphology that indicates the action of an adjacent verb is temporally simultaneous with that verb, code 1.  2. If there is a marker in the verbal morphology that indicates that the action of an adjacent verb is temporally sequential with that verb, code 1.  3. If clauses or verbs are combined in a way that implies sequential or simultaneous action but no overt verb marker is dedicated to this function, code 0.  4. If simultaneous or sequential temporal relationships are implied through the use of imperfective aspect or adverbial elements other than a dedicated verbal marker, code 0.		     Examples  **Southeastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: pom, Glottolog: sout2982)    Southeastern Pomo uses different markers on the verb to signal whether the action expressed by the following verb form happened in sequence with the action of the first verb, or simultaneous with the first verb.    *Simultaneous* -day    yiwi &577;a sca-day sma-n q'lal-ya    3SG 1SG be.there-SIMULT sleep get-PERF    'He fell asleep while I was there'      &577;a wit xbac'-day x&803;ol-o-di-t    1SG 1SG.obj ask-SIMULT hither-travel-POTENTIAL-IMPERF    'I'll come when he asks me'      *Sequential* -fla    &577;a x&803;ol-o-fla qnak'-ya    1SING hither-travel-SEQ fall.asleep-PERF    'He fell asleep after I came'      yiwi yoq-fla bxe t&803;laq-ya    3SING shoot-SEQ deer fall.over-PERF    'After he shot it, the deer fell over'    (Moshinsky 1974: 76)      Southeastern Pomo would be coded 1 because the temporal relationship between sequential events is marked by a suffix on the verb. There is also a marker on the verb to indicate simultaneous events. However, this language would still be coded 1 if only one of these temporal relationship markers existed.

However, there are languages where markers of paucal number appear on the noun. Sa is an example of code 1 for GB166, there is a paucal suffix (and trial).

This question concerns the existence of an anaphoric pronoun that specifically receives its referential identity from the subject of the superordinate clause in a reported speech construction (i.e. the speaker/thinker/feeler). In other words, is there a special pronominal form that occurs in the complement clause of a speech or thought verb, that designates the subject of the speech/thought verb as its referent (as opposed to any other referent)?     Procedure  1. If there is a pronominal form that is used in the complement clause of a speech/thought verb to indicate co-reference with the individual whose speech/thought is represented in that clause (i.e. the subject of the superordinate clause)...  2. And if this pronoun has a different form than the personal and reflexive pronoun, then code 1.  3. If the logophoric pronoun meets the criteria in (1) and (2) above, but is derived from another pronoun, code 1.  4. If there is no difference in the pro-form used when the referent in a reported speech subordinate clause is the individual whose speech is reported or a different individual, code 0.

Kofi be e-dzo    NAME say pro-leave    Kofi<sub>i</sub> said he/she<sub>j</sub> was leaving.    (Clements 1975: 142)    Ewe would be coded 1, because there is a special anaphoric pro-form used to indicate that the speaker (Kofi) who is the subject of the first clause is also the subject of the second clause. When Kofi is not the subject of the subordinate clause, a non-logophoric 3rd person pronoun is used.    This contrasts with a language like English, where no logophoric pronoun exists, and both of these meanings are expressed with the same form:    John<sub>i</sub> said he<sub>i/j</sub> was leaving.    This can mean that either John was leaving and said so, or that John said that someone else was leaving. English would be coded 0.     Further reading  Clements, George N. 1975.

Check the section on verbal morphology to identify whether the language has any indexing at all. Code 0 if it has not.  2. If there is indexing, consider which categories are indexed on the verb. Code 0 if only person and/or number and/or clusivity are indexed and the marking is consistent for both animate and inanimate referents.  3.

If no such section exists, search for words like ""own"", ""possess"" and ""have"", and see what you find in the descriptive text and in annotated examples  3. If there is no information on how predicative possession is expressed in the language, code as ""?"".  4. If it is clear that there is a finite transitive verb where the subject is the possessor and the direct object the possessed, code as ""1"".  5. If there are multiple constructions besides this one, code ""1"" and go on to the other questions on predicative possession and evaluate if these other constructions fit any of those.     Examples  **Swedish** (ISO 639-3: swe, Glottocode: swed1254)    Swedish is a germanic language and predicate possession is expressed with a habeo-verb construction that is cognate with the one in English.

GB296	Is there a phonologically or morphosyntactically definable class of ideophones that includes ideophones depicting imagery beyond sound?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	Ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery, e.g. 'glimmer', 'twiddle, 'tinkle'. In some languages, ideophones may have different morphosyntactic characteristics from other word classes (e.g. they have different morphology, or they have no morphology at all while other classes do; or they may be extremely free when it comes to word order, in comparison to other words). They may also feature sounds that are not present anywhere else in the language. Every language probably has ideophones, but not every language has a very well defined class of ideophones.	ideophone	iconicity	declension, conjugation, word order	Jakob	"Ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery, e.g. 'glimmer', 'twiddle, 'tinkle'. In some languages, ideophones may have different morphosyntactic characteristics from other word classes (e.g. they have different morphology, or they have no morphology at all while other classes do; or they may be extremely free when it comes to word order, in comparison to other words). They may also feature sounds that are not present anywhere else in the language. Every language probably has ideophones, but not every language has a very well defined class of ideophones.     Procedure    1. Code 1 if a source mentions ideophone-specific phonological or morphosyntactic characteristics, and gives examples of ideophones indicating imagery beyond sound.  2. Code 1 if a source mentions ideophones (beyond sound) and you can identify morphosyntactic or phonological properties that do not seem to apply to other word classes (e.g. word order, morphology).  3. Code 0 if a source mentions ideophones (beyond sound) but classifies them together with another word class morphosyntactically and does not mention specific phonological characteristics.  4. Code 0 if an otherwise comprehensive description does not mention ideophones.  5. Code 0 if only ideophones depicting auditory imagery are attested.  6. Code ? if you have reason to believe that the sources missed ideophones depicting imagery beyond sound or specific properties of ideophones in the language.     Examples    **Ewe** (ISO 639-3: ewe, Glottolog: ewee1241)    Ideophones in Ewe have (at least) three unusual phonological characteristics (Ameka 1991: 78):    * They can have short or long vowels without any change in meaning.  * Tone may be used sound-symbolically, so tone in ideophones is arguably more fluid.  * Syllables of ideophones may be reversed:    ```  nyadsii - drinyaa 'tough, hard'  kpɔdzɔɔ - dzɔkpɔɔ 'fat, thick'  tsaklii - klitsaa 'rough'  nogoo - gonoo 'round'  ```    **Buwal** (ISO 639-3: bhs, Glottolog: buwa1243)    In Viljoen's (2013: 67-70) grammar of Buwal, six phonologically uncommon characteristics of ideophones are discussed:    1. Changes in pitch, or lack of a clearly associated melody (cf. Ewe), e.g. *jāàȁȁ* 'noise of rain'  2. Long vowels and consonants, which do not occur often elsewhere (cf. Ewe), e.g. *fɐ́ːɾɐ́* 'manner of running slowly', *mbɛ̀ɮːɛ́* 'manner of staring fixedly'  3. Exaggerated aspiration, e.g. *pʰoe̋hʷ* 'noise of sudden entry or exit'  4. In other word classes, palatalized vowels only occur with front vowels, but in ideophones, they can also occur with non-front vowels: *kə̋tʃɐ̋ kə́tʃɐ́ kə̄tʃɐ̄ kə̀tʃɐ̀* 'cry of guinea fowl'  5. In other word classes, rounded vowels are typically found next to labialized velar consonants or labial-velar /w/. In ideophones, they are also found next to other consonants: *bőf* 'come out suddenly', *ɐ̀túl* 'manner of smoke ascending'  6. /ə/ and its allophones don't usually occur in final syllables, but they do in ideophones: *bɪm̋* 'noise of sudden digging', *ɐ̀túl* 'manner of smoke ascending'    One morphosyntactic characteristic of ideophones in Buwal is repetition or reduplication to a greater extent than in other word classes, e.g. *ŋɡɐ̄m ŋɡɐ̀m ŋɡɐ̄m ŋɡɐ̀m* 'noise of grinding'    **Luchazi** (ISO 639-3: lch, Glottolog: luch1239)    For Luchazi, Fleisch (2000: 45) states that ideophones feature consonant clusters and sounds that do not occur in other parts of speech. He does not, however, provide examples, but this statement is enough to warrant a 1 for this feature in Grambank.    **Bangi** (ISO 639-3: bni, Glottolog: bang1354)    Whitehead (1899: 18) discusses a class of sound-symbolic 'indeclinable adjectives' in Bangi (in his words: ""they may be traced to an onomatopoetic origin"", they are """"colouring"" words"").    These ideophones are grammatically characterized by a lack of noun class agreement and person indexing, which applies to verbs, other adjectives, and nouns.    Some examples:    ```  ca 'scattered'  kākatanu 'puzzling'  kō-kō 'tied up'  tī 'intent, still, cool'  zölôlô 'whirling'  ```    **Chinook** (ISO 639-3: cch, Glottolog: chin1286)     Similarly to Whitehead for Bangi, Boas (1911: 627) describes a class of words in Chinook of ""onomatopoetic origin"" that do not require pronominal indexes.

This question aims to capture phonologically free-standing elements that inflect (i.e. change form depending on arguments, environment or such).

A crucial aspect of this feature is that the main verb should behave as it does when it is combined with other auxiliary verbs, which is often that it loses finite marking (infinite/connegative mood).

GB301	Is there an inclusory construction?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	Definition: a plural NP that would be expressed in English by an expression of the type ‘Harald and I talked’ or ‘Harald and us talked’ is expressed by a construction of the type [superset: pronoun] [set: noun/Proper noun], e.g. ‘we.two Harald talked’ / ‘we Harald talked’, respectively. Note: In some languages this would be expressed by associative duals/plurals, e.g. Harald-AssDu / AssPl talked’ for ‘[Someone and] Harald talked’, though this tends to be used for non-first-person groups only.

The former absolutive argument (O) becomes an oblique, locative argument in the antipassive clause.

Examples    **Zuni** (ISO 639-3: zun, Glottolog: zuni1245)    Zuni does not allow the addition of an agent role to a passive clause (Nichols 1997: 126):    ```  hom nicikya 'uk-na-'kya  1SG.ACC ring give-passive-past  'I was given a ring.'    *tom 'an hom nicikya 'uk-na-'kya  2SG.ACC P 1SG.ACC ring give-passive-past  'I was given a ring by you.'    *tom 'akkya hom nicikya 'uk-na-'kya  2SG.ACC with 1SG.ACC ring give-passive-past  'I was given a ring by you.'  ```    **Liko** (ISO 639-3: lik, Glottolog: lika1243)    de Wit (2015: 410-414) does not recognize a passive construction in his grammar of Liko. He does recognize a morphological neutro-passive, however (2015: 374-375), which, he argues, is distinct from passives in that it does not allow an agent to be expressed. Its function is to detransitivize a verb and to indicate that the subject is the one affected by the action denoted by the verb. Because of this function the neutro-passive does qualify as a passive for the purpose of Grambank, and the fact that the agent cannot occur with the neutro-passive makes Liko an example of a language coded with 0 in Grambank.    Some examples of the neutro-passive derivation, with *-ɩ́k* in Liko:    ```  ká-nʊw-á 'to tear' → ká-nʊw-ɩ́k-á 'to tear, intransitive'  kó-ɓún-ó 'to break' → kó-ɓún-ík-ó 'to break, intransitive'  ```    **Raji** (ISO 639-3: rji, Glottolog: raji1240)    Raji has a passive suffix, *-i*. Passive constructions allow the expression of the agent marked with ablative case (Khatri 2008: 27):    ```  ram -ɦatiŋ bʌtaŋ dza –i –k -a  Ram -ABL rice eat -PASS -SD -PST  'Rice was eaten by Ram.'    ram -ɦatiŋ bʰwa sʌtika  Ram -ABL bird kill -PASS -SD -PST  'The bird was killed by Ram.'  ```     Further reading    Haspelmath, M.

As such, it qualifies as a bipartite reciprocal pronoun and does not trigger a 1 for this feature.    ```  Eltahl luhngse sie sin sie.  they like one of one  'They like each other.'    Kuht etuh sie sin sie.  we know one of one  'We know each other.'  ```    **Western Farsi** (ISO 639-3: pes, Glottolog: west2369)    Western Farsi features both a bipartite reciprocal pronoun, *ye ... digar* (or *yak ... digar*) and a non-bipartite one, *ham* (Windfuhr & Perry 2009: 437), which also means 'same' in other parts of the grammar.

GB309	Are there multiple past or multiple future tenses, distinguishing distance from Time of Reference?	1: present, 0: absent	NA	NA	NA	NA	This question aims at capturing productive marking of tense that makes distinctions into remoteness of time in relation to the point of reference or utterance. The actual marking can tonal, verbal affixation, suppletion or any other means of marking. Beware that it is important to tease out if the distinction is aspectual or modal rather than temporal. For example, present perfect is a kind of aspect that involves current relevance, and may therefore more likely occur in recent time - but it can refer to events further in the past as well.	verb, auxiliary, particle	TAM, tense	conjugation, special construction	Hedvig	"This question aims at capturing productive marking of tense that makes distinctions into remoteness of time in relation to the point of reference or utterance. The actual marking can tonal, verbal affixation, suppletion or any other means of marking. Beware that it is important to tease out if the distinction is aspectual or modal rather than temporal. For example, ""present perfect"" is a kind of aspect that involves ""current relevance"", and may therefore more likely occur in recent time - but it can refer to events further in the past as well.     Procedure  1. Look up the section(s) in the language description that deals with tense.  2. Check if there are markers of past or future tense at all.  3. If more than one function of future or past tense are described, and marked by separate forms: investigate whether the distinctions are aspectual or modal, or indeed relate to remoteness on the temporal axis.  4. If there is only one form-function mapping for past and future tense (or indeed none at all), code the language as ""0"".  5. If it is unclear whether the distinction is aspectual/modal or temporal, code the language as ""?"".  6. If there are several function-form pair described, but with little motivation and few examples to clearly explain what is going on, code the language as ""?"".  7. If it is clearly stated that the distinction has to do with remoteness of time, code the language as ""1"".     Examples    **Sudest** (ISO 639-3: tgo, Glottocode: sude1239)    In Sudest, there are distinctions remoteness in both past and future tenses. Anderson & Ross(2002:335-339) outlines this in a paradigm and also gives the examples below. Sudest is coded as 1 for this feature.    <pre><code>    1)  Va thï=utu        DIST.PAST 3PL=talk        'They talked'      2)  Methï=wa e la-ma nggolo        IMM.PAST:3PL=go PREP POSS-1EXC:PL house        'They went (today or yesterday) to my house.      3) Na ya-wa        IMM.FUT 1SG=go       'They will go (today)'      4) Ne thï=kwaio       FUT 3PL= work       'They will work (after today)'  </code></pre>    Below is a helpful excerpt on the typological literature on this phenomena from a PhD thesis by Hayashi on Multiple tenses in Inuktitut.     _Cross-linguistically, it is not rare for a language to have multiple past (or future) tenses that cover different temporal domains (Dahl, 1983, 1985, 2008; Comrie, 1985; Mithun, 1999; Dahl and Velupillai, 2005:269)._    _Such languages are especially common in the Bantu family, the Australian Aboriginal languages, and the Native American languages (Comrie, 1985). When a language has two past tenses covering different temporal domains, the cut-off point (boundary) is most commonly placed between ‘today’ and ‘before today’, in which case the tenses can be labeled with Latinate terms as hodiernal past and pre-hodiernal past (Dahl, 1983, 1985, 2008; Comrie, 1985; Dahl and Velupillai, 2005). Another common cut-off point is that between ‘recently’ and ‘longer ago’. When a language has more than two past tenses, additional cut-off points may be placed between ‘yesterday’ and ‘before yesterday’, between ‘a few days ago’ and ‘more than a few days ago’, between ‘this year’ and ‘before this year’, etc._    _Comrie (1985) also points out that tense systems across languages may contrast with one another not only with respect to how they segment the time-line, but also with respect to how rigid the boundaries between the segments are. Haya, for example, has three past tenses covering ‘today’ (the hodiernal past), ‘yesterday’ (the hesternal past), and ‘before yesterday’ (the pre-hesternal past). Their boundaries are rigid, in the sense that the hodiernal past can never be used to describe a situation in a time prior to the day of utterance. Sotho, in contrast, has the opposition of ‘recently’ vs. ‘not recently’, where the boundary is fluid in the sense that what counts as recent is left to the speaker’s subjective impression; it is possible, thus, to describe an event that took place several years or decades ago with a recent past form, as long as the speaker intends to emphasize the subjective recency._    [Hayashi 2011](http://www.semanticsarchive.net/Archive/GE1YzI1Y/Hayashi_phdthesis_2011.pdf)       Further reading    Anderson, Mike and Malcolm Ross. 2002.

If the language has one or more grammatical marker(s) (affixes, other morphology, particles auxiliaries) that is dedicated to expressing that the speaker has indirect evidence (e.g. hearsay, inference) of an event or action, code 1.  2. If the language does not use a grammatical marker to indicate that the speaker has indirect evidence of an event or action, code 0.  3. If the language expresses indirect evidence of an event or action only through the use of adverbs or lexical verbs in some periphrastic construction, code 0.     Examples  **Eastern Pomo** (ISO 639-3: peb, Glottocode: east2545)    '[-·le] The hearsay evidential suffix indicates that the speaker's information comes not from direct observation or experience, but rather from someone else's recounting of the events described. The hearsay evidential is generally not translated, but occasionally, for greater clarity, I have translated it with the phrase 'they say'. The hearsay evidential suffix always co-occurs with the hearsay evidential particle /xa/ which may be preposed to the verb suffixed with [-·le] or which may occur as a separate word at the beginning of a clause of which the verb suffixed with [-·le] is the head' (McLendon 1975: 99).    /ša·qá·xdàyawal xa šó·llà·yówal wádu·kè·le/ 'Quail-Young lady' 'hearsay evidential' 'eastwards-under the sun' 'went,(hearsay evidential)' (McLendon 1975: 100)    Eastern Pomo is coded as '1' for GB323.

GB324	Is there an interrogative verb for content interrogatives (who?, what?, etc.)?	1: present, 0: absent					Interrogative verbs are verbs that include a semantic wh-element. In other words, the semantic content of interrogative verb roots includes an element equivalent to a content question (also called a wh-element), e.g., meaning 'to do what' or 'to be who'. The wh-element needs to behave like a verb in the language, e.g., if the language is English, it should take verbal morphology, appearing, e.g., as in 'you what-ed yesterday?' (to mean 'you did what yesterday?'). The feature does not include verbs of asking or interrogative forms created through affixation of interrogative markers to non-interrogative verb roots.	verb, interrogative	mood, interrogation	conjugation, paradigm	Hannah	"Interrogative verbs are verbs that include a semantic wh-element.

Check whether any of the S, A and P arguments are flagged in any context. Consider only the major/default predicate class, ignore any verbs with non-canonical/special flagging (e.g. the so-called ""dative-subject"" or experiencer verbs). Consider only independent clauses.  2. If there is flagging, consider which of the three arguments S, A, and P are marked identically and which differently.   3. Code 1 if the P argument is marked differently from the S argument. It does not matter whether the differences are between two overt markers or an overt marker and a zero.  4. Be aware of the differences in marking conditioned by pronoun vs. noun distinction, person, animacy, etc. Code 1 even if only some Ps (e.g. only some pronouns or only definite Ps) are coded differently from the S argument. If, a small class of nouns does not take a particular flagging for phonological or morphological reasons, ignore this class.  5.

If in a language a particular argument role is never filled with an independent pronoun (so there is a gap for flagging on pronouns in a particular argument role), whereas other roles can be expressed with a pronoun, this should be considered as a difference in indexing and coded appropriately.     Examples  **Code 1: Imonda** (imn/imon1245, Border)  Imonda marks only animate P arguments with a special marker glossed as -GL, asin (c).   Inanimate Ps are unmarked, as in (d).   This is sufficient to code Imonda as having accusative alignment of flagging, though this alignment type is restricted to animate arguments.    ```  a. aia-l      agõ-l-i       e-uagl-ual-n     father-NOM woman-NOM-CO  DL-go-DL-PST     ‘His father and his wife went away.’ (Seiler 1985: 180)    b. ti   ed  he-li-f     tree PX  CL-lie-PRS     ‘The tree lies over there.’ (Seiler 1985: 159)       c. aia-l       edel-m    ue-ne-uõl  fe-f     father-NOM  human-GL  CL-eat-PL  dp-PRS     ‘Her father habitually eats humans.’ (Seiler 1985: 165)          d. ti    he-ual-n     three cut-DL-PST     ‘He chopped down two trees.’ (Seiler 1985: 81)  ```     Further reading  [Bernard Comrie. 2013.

Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that precedes and is phonologically bound to that possessed noun.     Procedure  1.

A nominal possessor or possessive pronoun may also be included in the phrase. Nominal possessors follow the possessed noun in unmarked constructions, but may appear to the left of the possessum when they are in contrastive focus. Pronominal possessors occur to the left of possessed nouns. Alienable possession uses the same prefixes as inalienable possession, but also includes an alienable possession suffix on the possessed noun. Nanti would be coded 1 for this feature because it has a possessive construction that uses a prefix on the possessed noun to mark the possession relationship.

These languages are often called 'pro-drop' languages, and the phenomenon is generally referred to as 'null anaphora' or 'zero anaphora'.     Here 'omitted' means phonologically unexpressed (we do not intend for this feature to make any distinctions regarding the theoretical status of a null anaphor). To count as (1), pro-drop should occur where the S or A argument might otherwise be expressed by an independent pronoun or full noun phrase. Specifically, pro-drop should occur in simple, declarative main clauses.     Pro-drop is not mutually exclusive with indexing of the S or A argument on the verb. If, in the absence of an independent pronoun or nominal S or A, there is indexing of this argument on the verb, you may still code 1.     Procedure  1. If the S or A argument may be omitted when its referent can be inferred from context, code 1.  2. If the S or A argument is always phonologically expressed, code 0.       Examples  **Czech** (ISO 639-3: ces, Glottolog: czec1258)    Czech allows S and A arguments to be expressed by pronouns when the referent is understood from context, but it also allows these subject arguments to be phonologically unexpressed.    Jan v&269;era nav&353;t&237;v-il     Name yesterday visit-Past.Masc     Jan visited yesterday.      (on) &345;&237;d-il auto    (3S.Masc) drive-Past.Masc car    He drove a car.      (on) m-&283;l t&345;i kufr-y    (3S.Masc) have-Past.Masc three suitcase-Pl    He had three suitcases.      The pronouns in parenthesis in the examples above can be omitted, and in fact would be in most natural contexts. The resulting constructions with no phonologically overt subjects where a pronoun would otherwise occur would lead to a (1) code for Czech.
